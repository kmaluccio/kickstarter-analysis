# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview
Perform an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends and help Louise make decisions about her current Kickstarter.
We are interested in theater/plays in the US, so we focus on this parent/subcategory and country for our analysis.
More specifically, we analylze the data based on the launch date and goals chart from these similar kickstarters to deliver our results.
### Purpose
To help Louise learn about different kickstarter campaigns to compare with her campaign and help her be more successful.
## Analysis and Challenges
All data, descriptive and category statistics can be found in the file: [Kickstarter_Challenge](Desktop/Analysis_Projects/Crowdfunding_Analysis/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)

We note that Louise is asking for over double the average successful Kickstarter goal which is not so good for her campaign. {DESCRIBE MORE RESULTS OF ANALYSIS HERE}

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The line chart for theater outcomes vs launch date, shows us that the most successful month to launch this kickstarter is in May and the least successful month is December. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
We can conclude that the theater has the most number of successful campaigns which is good news for Louise and shows she has a better chance of being successful.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
